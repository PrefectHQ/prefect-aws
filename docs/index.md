## Welcome!

The `prefect-aws` collection makes it easy to leverage the capabilities of AWS in your flows, featuring support for ECSTask, S3, Secrets Manager, Batch Job, and Client Waiter.


## Getting Started

### Saving credentials to a block

You will need an AWS account and credentials in order to use `prefect-aws`.

1. Refer to the [AWS Configuration documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-creds) on how to retrieve your access key ID and secret access key
2. Copy the access key ID and secret access key
3. Create a short script and replace the placeholders with your credential information and desired block name:

```python
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials
AwsCredentials(
    aws_access_key_id="PLACEHOLDER",
    aws_secret_access_key="PLACEHOLDER",
    aws_session_token=None,  # replace this with token if necessary
    region_name="us-east-2"
).save("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

Congrats! You can now load the saved block to use your credentials in your Python code:
 
```python
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials
AwsCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

!!! info "Registering blocks"

    Register blocks in this module to
    [view and edit them](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/)
    on Prefect Cloud:

    ```bash
    prefect block register -m prefect_aws
    ```

### Using Prefect with AWS ECS

`prefect_aws` allows you to use [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) as infrastructure for your deployments. Using ECS for scheduled flow runs enabled the dynamic provisioning of infrastructure for containers and unlocked greater scalability.

The snippets below show how you can use `prefect_aws` to run a task on ECS. It uses the `ECSTask` block as [Prefect infrastructure](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/infrastructure/) or simply within a flow.

#### As deployment Infrastructure


##### Set variables

To expedite copy/paste without the needing to update placeholders manually, update and execute the following.

```bash
export CREDENTIALS_BLOCK_NAME="aws-credentials"
export VPC_ID="vpc-id"
export ECS_TASK_BLOCK_NAME="ecs-task-example"
export S3_BUCKET_BLOCK_NAME="ecs-task-bucket-example"
```

##### Save an infrastructure and storage block

Save a custom infrastructure and storage block by executing the following snippet.

```python
import os
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials, ECSTask, S3Bucket

aws_credentials = AwsCredentials.load(os.environ["CREDENTIALS_BLOCK_NAME"])

ecs_task = ECSTask(
    image="prefecthq/prefect:2-python3.10",
    aws_credentials=aws_credentials,
    vpc_id=os.environ["VPC_ID"],
)
ecs_task.save(os.environ["ECS_TASK_BLOCK_NAME"], overwrite=True)

bucket_name = "ecs-task-bucket-example"
s3_client = aws_credentials.get_s3_client()
s3_client.create_bucket(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    CreateBucketConfiguration={"LocationConstraint": aws_credentials.region_name}
)
s3_bucket = S3Bucket(
    bucket_name=bucket_name,
    aws_credentials=aws_credentials,
)
s3_bucket.save(os.environ["S3_BUCKET_BLOCK_NAME"], overwrite=True)
```

##### Write a flow

Then, use an existing flow to create a deployment with, or use the flow below if you don't have an existing flow handy.

```python
from prefect import flow

@flow(log_prints=True)
def ecs_task_flow():
    print("Hello, Prefect!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ecs_task_flow()
```

##### Create a deployment

If the script was named "ecs_task_script.py", build a deployment manifest with the following command.

```bash
prefect deployment build ecs_task_script.py:ecs_task_flow \
    -n ecs-task-deployment \
    -ib ecs-task/${ECS_TASK_BLOCK_NAME} \
    -sb s3-bucket/${S3_BUCKET_BLOCK_NAME} \
    --override env.EXTRA_PIP_PACKAGES=prefect-aws
```

Now apply the deployment!

```bash
prefect deployment apply ecs_task_flow-deployment.yaml
```

##### Test the deployment

Start up an agent in a separate terminal. The agent will poll the Prefect API for scheduled flow runs that are ready to run.

```bash
prefect agent start -q 'default'
```

Run the deployment once to test.

```bash
prefect deployment run ecs-task-flow/ecs-task-deployment
```

Once the flow run has completed, you will see `Hello, Prefect!` logged in the Prefect UI.

!!! info "No class found for dispatch key"

    If you encounter an error message like `KeyError: "No class found for dispatch key 'ecs-task' in registry for type 'Block'."`,
    ensure `prefect-aws` is installed in the environment that your agent is running!

Another tutorial on `ECSTask` can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/prefect-aws-ecs-fargate-github-actions-make-serverless-dataflows-as-easy-as-py-f6025335effc).

#### Within Flow

You can also execute commands through ECS Task directly within a Prefect flow. Running containers via ECS in your flows is useful for executing non-python code in a distributed manner via Prefect.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials
from prefect_aws.ecs import ECSTask

@flow
def ecs_task_flow():
    ecs_task = ECSTask(
        image="prefecthq/prefect:2-python3.10",
        credentials=AwsCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER"),
        region="us-east-2",
        command=["echo", "Hello, Prefect!"],
    )
    return ecs_task.run()
```

### Using Prefect with AWS S3

`prefect_aws` allows you to read and write objects with AWS S3 within your Prefect flows.

The provided code snippet shows how you can use `prefect_aws` to upload a file to a AWS S3 bucket and download the same file under a different file name.

Note, the following code assumes that the bucket already exists.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from prefect import flow
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials, S3Bucket

@flow
def s3_flow():
    # create a dummy file to upload
    file_path = Path("test-example.txt")
    file_path.write_text("Hello, Prefect!")

    aws_credentials = AwsCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    s3_bucket = S3Bucket(
        bucket_name="BUCKET-NAME-PLACEHOLDER",
        aws_credentials=aws_credentials
    )

    s3_bucket_path = s3_bucket.upload_from_path(file_path)
    downloaded_file_path = s3_bucket.download_object_to_path(
        s3_bucket_path, "downloaded-test-example.txt"
    )
    return downloaded_file_path.read_text()

s3_flow()
```

### Using Prefect with AWS Secrets Manager

`prefect_aws` allows you to read and write secrets with AWS Secrets Manager within your Prefect flows.

The provided code snippet shows how you can use `prefect_aws` to write a secret to the Secret Manager, read the secret data, delete the secret, and finally return the secret data.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials, AwsSecret

@flow
def secrets_manager_flow():
    aws_credentials = AwsCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    aws_secret = AwsSecret(secret_name="test-example", aws_credentials=aws_credentials)
    aws_secret.write_secret(secret_data=b"Hello, Prefect!")
    secret_data = aws_secret.read_secret()
    aws_secret.delete_secret()
    return secret_data

secrets_manager_flow()
```
